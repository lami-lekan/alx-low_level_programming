bout Singly Linked List in C

A singly linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science and programming. This README provides an introduction to singly linked lists in C, explaining their concepts, usage, and implementation.

## What is a Singly Linked List?

A singly linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, each represented by a node. Each node has two parts:
- Data: The actual value or data stored in the node.
- Next: A reference (pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

Singly linked lists are characterized by their unidirectional structure, where you can traverse the list only in one direction, typically from the head (the first node) to the tail (the last node).

## Key Features

- **Insertion**: You can add elements at the beginning, end, or at specific positions within the list.
- **Deletion**: Elements can be removed from the list based on their value or position.
- **Traversal**: You can visit each node, examine its data, and perform operations on the data.
- **Searching**: Find a specific element by value and return its position or node.
- **Length**: Determine the number of elements in the list.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Singly linked lists are memory-efficient compared to arrays, as they can dynamically grow or shrink.

## How to Use

If you want to work with singly linked lists in C, here are some steps to get you started:

1. Include the necessary headers and libraries for your C program.

2. Define a `struct` to represent the nodes of your linked list. The structure should contain a data element and a pointer to the next node.

3. Create functions for common operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, searching, and determining the length of the list.

4. Allocate and free memory as needed, particularly when inserting and deleting nodes.

5. Implement a `main` function that demonstrates the use of your singly linked list functions.

## Example Code

Here's a simple example of how to create and manipulate a singly linked list in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "singly_linked_list.h"

int main() {
    LinkedList* list = createLinkedList();
    
    insertFront(list, 42);
    insertFront(list, 10);
    insertEnd(list, 100);

    printList(list);
    
    deleteElement(list, 10);
    printList(list);

    destroyLinkedList(list);

    return 0;
}
