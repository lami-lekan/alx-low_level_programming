## Introduction

C is a compiled programming language, which means that the source code you write must go through a series of steps to become an executable program. The compilation process involves several stages, each responsible for a specific task, such as translating high-level code into machine code and resolving dependencies.

## The Compilation Process

### Source Code

1. **Source Code**: You start by writing your C code in a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE). The source code is typically stored in one or more `.c` files.

### Preprocessing

2. **Preprocessing**: Before compilation, the C preprocessor (`cpp`) performs tasks such as including header files, macro expansion, and conditional compilation. The output is called "preprocessed code."

### Compilation

3. **Compilation**: The C compiler (`gcc`, `clang`, etc.) translates the preprocessed code into assembly language code, which is specific to the target machine's architecture. This step produces an "object file" (usually `.o` or `.obj`).

### Assembly

4. **Assembly**: The assembler (`as`) converts the assembly code into machine code instructions. The result is often referred to as "machine code" or "object code."

### Linking

5. **Linking**: The linker (`ld`) takes one or more object files and resolves external references and dependencies. It combines them into an executable program. Libraries, both system and user-defined, can be linked during this stage.

## Execution

Once the compilation process is complete and you have an executable file, you can execute your C program directly from the command line or using an IDE. The program runs on the target machine, producing the desired output.

## Common Compiler Commands

- `gcc filename.c -o output`: Compile a C source file and specify the output executable file.
- `gcc -c filename.c`: Compile a C source file without linking, producing an object file.
- `gcc -o executable filename1.o filename2.o`: Link multiple object files into an executable.
- `./executable`: Run the compiled program from the command line.

## Debugging

Debugging is an essential part of the development process. Tools like `gdb` and IDEs provide debugging capabilities, allowing you to identify and fix issues in your C code.
